How to properly change permalinks in wordpress 
(without having to manually paste generated wordpress code to .htaccess file)


Issues: 
  a. Dropping index.php on website url.
  b. Avoid manual copy-paste of generated wordpress code to .htaccess file.


Environment: Using lampp in Ubuntu 16.04.


Procedure/s:

1. On your terminal, navigate to your project folder. 

2. Enter as superuser.

    sudo su


3. Check if you have existing .htaccess file. If none, then create one.
    
    nano .htaccess


4. Change .htaccess mode to 777 (writable).

    sudo chmod 777 .htaccess


5. On your Wordpress Admin panel, go to Settings->Permalinks.

6. Under Common Settings select desired url structure (in this case, Post name) or go to Custom Structure and delete index.php.

7. Save Changes.

8. On your terminal, check updated* .htaccess file. 

    nano .htaccess

   *.htaccess file is now updated with proper code from wordpress similar to the following (as it differs depending on the selected url structure in step# 6):

        # BEGIN WordPress
        # The directives (lines) between `BEGIN WordPress` and `END WordPress` are
        # dynamically generated, and should only be modified via WordPress filters.
        # Any changes to the directives between these markers will be overwritten.
        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /your-project/
        RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        RewriteRule . /your-project/index.php [L]
        </IfModule>

        # END WordPress
